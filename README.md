# Seeing-Evens
#
# Seeing Evens can be played as a single player game or two players where the user plays against an 
# AI. The game gives the option to the user to play several games, possibly playing each game in a different style, 
# and think away at cracking this enigma! The goal for the user is to strategically insert numbers into a grid in order
# get a even sum for every column and row. At the end of each game, the program presents a surprise 
# to the user with some totals and some colorful visuals associated to the game end-results, and invites the
# user to play more games. At the end of all games some general totals are shown. Have Fun!
